# PlateChecker

PlateChecker is a react native app that I did for a college project where the user can use the cellphone camera to check some information about a car, such as: year, chassi, model, year, legal situation, last update date and city.

### Tech

PlateChecker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* ReactNative
* OpenALPR


### Installation

PlateChecker requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10.16+ and XCode/AndroidStudio to run.

For a detailed step by step on how to run the app please read the [ReactNative getting started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started).

After that you can do the following:

```sh
$ cd plate-checker-fiap
$ npm install
```

### Run on simulated device

```sh
$ npx react-native run-ios
```

or

```sh
$ npx react-native run-android
```


### Running on real device

To run on a real device please read the [ReactNative documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device).
